          <span>In</span> understanding the difference between health and
          wellness, in short, health is a state of being,whereas wellness is the
          state of living a healthy lifestyle . Health refers to physical,
          mental, and social well-being; wellness aims to enhance well-being.<br /><br />

          Life in practice is undoubtedly fraught with stresses, and so much so
          that we can — and should — question whether they are threatening the
          health and wellness of veterinarians.<q
            >Can stress affect health? Absolutely. It can affect physical,
            mental, and social well-being.</q
          >
          Can stress affect wellness? Yes, but only to a point, in that it can
          affect one's perspective or dampen one's energy, negatively
          influencing one's commitment to self-care and the aim to achieve one's
          fullest potential. The difference is that wellness is always a matter
          of choice.<br /><br />

          Every day presents choices as to the extent to which you do what's
          best to sustain your physical, mental/emotional, and social
          well-being, and preserve the balance among these aspects of your
          health. Optimal health comes from wellness, from making decisions and
          practicing behaviors that are based on sound health knowledge and
          healthful attitudes.<br /><br />

          A fulfilling life is not easy, but there are ways to achieve it in a
          simpleer manner. Right amount of
          <a href="#">slpeep</a>, a balanced <a href="#">diet</a>, proper
          <a href="#">exercises</a> and claming <a href="#">meditation</a> can
          fixed maney problem in your life.
          <q
            >While you cannot choose the state of health, you can consciously
            choose wellness by living your life responsibly and taking proactive
            steps for your well-being.</q
          >
          Health comprises the diagnosis of a disease/illness, predisposition to
          a disease, and any unexpected injury.Wellness is an active process of
          growth and change to reach your fullest health and well-being.
          <q
            >It is associated with actively pursuing activities, making choices
            and lifestyle changes, controlling risk factorsthat can harm a
            person, focusing on nutrition, having a balanced diet, and following
            spiritual practices that lead to holistic health.</q
          >Risk factors are actions or conditions that increase a persons risk
          of illness or injury. Some of the risk factors that can be harmful to
          good health are as follows:<br /><br />
          <b>Smoking:</b> It is a major risk factor for lung cancer and
          cardiovascular diseases.<br /><br />
          <b>Drinking alcohol:</b> It can cause liver damage, stroke, heart
          diseases, and cancer.<br /><br />
          <b>Unprotected sex:</b> It spreads sexually transmitted diseases
          including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br /><br />
          <b>Extreme physical activity/sports:</b> This may lead to broken bones
          and other types of injuries.<br /><br />
          In conclusion , it is clear that health and wlleness should be our
          priority, but we often forget that and get involved in unhealthy
          activities and suffer. However, it is possible to live happyly and
          healtheyly if we do exercise, meditation , eate a balanced diet and
          sleep adiquitly.
